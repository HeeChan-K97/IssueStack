The NSW International Student Arrivals Pilot Plan to return international students to NSW has received support from the Australian Government and NSW Government.

The Pilot Plan will allow a limited number of 250 international students studying with NSW education providers to return each fortnight from early December 2021.

For now – under the Pilot initially – international students who return to Australia must be fully vaccinated with a Therapeutic Good Administration (TGA) recognised COVID-19 vaccination before landing in Sydney.

International students will quarantine in purpose-built student accommodation in Sydney and adhere to the same health and quarantine requirements set by the Australian Government for returning Australians.

The NSW International Student Arrivals Pilot Plan will not displace any returning Australians and be fully funded by industry, with in-kind support provided by the NSW Government around logistics and the coordination of their return.
