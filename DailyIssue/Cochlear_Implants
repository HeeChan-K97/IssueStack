Several alternatives to hearing implants currently exist, although cochlear implants are focused on due to their success rate, efficiency and spike in prevalence among the hearing-impaired population. The cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides an individual with sensorineural (damage to tiny hair cells) hearing loss an altered sense of sound via electrical stimulation. These hearing devices are produced by Cochlear Australia, formed in 1981 and whose headquarters are located in Sydney, Australia.
Since the effects of COVID-19, Cochlear Australia’s implant sales have seen a rebound with implant sales and revenue nearing where they were prior to the pandemic. This can be attributed to Cochlear’s launch of the latest sound processor along with an increasing recipient base, “with revenue from the company's services segment running at about 86 per cent of last year.” (Redrup, 2020) The latest sound processor, ‘The Nucleus® 7 Sound Processor’ is a major component replacement or improvement enabling smartphone compatibility, extended battery life (up to 50% longer) and is the smallest, lightest hearing solution available. A significant economic problem associated with the updated Cochlear implant technology is the cost for patients. With the cost being the number one disadvantage, in Australia it would cost around $25,000 to $50,000 and although those with private health insurance may receive subsidies, the cost would still be relatively high.
Hearing loss is a major global concern as individuals who possess this disability experience communication and social connectedness impairment, thus impacting their quality of life. This project was chosen as Cochlear implants are an ever-growing technology within my field of biomedical engineering that assists in providing a substantial number of individuals who suffer from hearing loss with a second chance. It is also a company I wish to work for during my future career and an analysis of this project could benefit both the company and individual, to come up with a less costly alternative sound processor that would increase sales due to higher demand and ultimately cost the patient less.
